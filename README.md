## PearchDigital Test

All Javascript code are pure Javascript, no JS library (e.g. jQuery etc.) used.

Database info used in Question 002 are only an example, please use your own DB connection details and pre-set table 'users' if you need to run it.

Please set a remote endpoint and update the value of variable $url at line 41 in curl.php for Question 003 if you really want to test it in real world. Currently just a example URL 'http://dev.test06/index.php'.

You can run 001 and 004 directly in your local server to see the result.
